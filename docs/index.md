# üöÄ PowerNukkitX Documentation

:::info[PowerNukkitX 2.0 experimental version]
Currently, version 2.0 of PowerNukkitX is very unstable, but the entire PowerNukkitX team is increasingly addressing the issues.
:::

Welcome to the official documentation for PowerNukkitX, a feature-rich, highly customizable third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## üìï The Story of PowerNukkitX {#-story}

PowerNukkitX was born out of a desire to provide a more customizable and powerful server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Our team of dedicated developers and Minecraft enthusiasts saw the potential for a server software that could offer more than what was currently available.

We started development in 2020, with the goal of creating a server software that was not only powerful and customizable, but also user-friendly and accessible to all. We wanted to create a tool that would allow server owners to truly make their Minecraft world their own.

In 2023, the project was taken over by [CoolLoong](https://github.com/CoolLoong), who brought a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table. Under Coolong's leadership, PowerNukkitX has continued to grow and evolve, maintaining its commitment to providing a powerful and customizable server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

Since then, PowerNukkitX has grown and evolved, with new features and improvements being added regularly. We've been overwhelmed by the positive response from the Minecraft community, and we're excited to continue developing and improving PowerNukkitX.
