# 🚀 PowerNukkitX Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for PowerNukkitX, a feature-rich, highly customizable third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## 📕 The Story of PowerNukkitX

PowerNukkitX was born out of a desire to provide a more customizable and powerful server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Our team of dedicated developers and Minecraft enthusiasts saw the potential for a server software that could offer more than what was currently available.

We started development in 2020, with the goal of creating a server software that was not only powerful and customizable, but also user-friendly and accessible to all. We wanted to create a tool that would allow server owners to truly make their Minecraft world their own.
