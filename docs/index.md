## üìï The Story of **PowerNukkitX** {#-story}

**PowerNukkitX** was born out of a desire to provide a more customizable and powerful server software for **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**. Our team of dedicated developers and **Minecraft** enthusiasts saw the potential for a server software that could offer more than what was currently available.

> We started development in 2020, with the goal of creating a server software that was not only powerful and customizable, but also user-friendly and accessible to all. We wanted to create a tool that would allow server owners to truly make their **Minecraft** world their own.

In 2023, the project was taken over by **[CoolLoong](https://github.com/CoolLoong)**, who brought a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table. Under Coolong's leadership, **PowerNukkitX** has continued to grow and evolve, maintaining its commitment to providing a powerful and customizable server software for **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**.
