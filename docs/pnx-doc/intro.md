## What is PowerNukkitX?  

PowerNukkitX (PNX) is a branch version of Nukkit developed and maintained by Chinese Nukkit developers, including the BlocklyNukkit team. It fixes numerous bugs, improves performance, supports new versions promptly, supports all new blocks and items in 1.18, supports the new Nether in the latest version, and supports the Epic Terrain Generator (Terra). Despite these major changes, PNX still maintains good plugin compatibility, and thousands of plugins in the Nukkit ecosystem can still run on PNX.

Thanks to its completely open-source code, using PowerNukkitX poses no legal risks as long as you comply with the open-source license. With hundreds of thousands of APIs internally, you can freely call them, delve into implementations, and develop, debug, inject, and intercept conveniently through various tools in the JVM ecosystem. Consequently, the Nukkit ecosystem is rich and diverse, with hundreds of plugins available for you to choose from. You can write plugins in any JVM language you like, such as Java, Kotlin, Scala, Python, Javascript, Lua, etc.

## Why Do We Develop PNX?  

The most direct reason is: a strong core leads to a strong ecosystem. 
We can openly say that, after deduplication, the Nukkit ecosystem is one of the largest among Bedrock Edition works and one of the highest-tech circles among Bedrock Edition communities. However, after the Nukkit core development team was bought by CubeCraft to develop the Geyser project, the development intensity sharply declined. With many foreign developers entering the Java Edition community and the domestic Bedrock Edition community gradually strengthening, the Nukkit core gradually failed to keep pace with the development of the Bedrock community. As practitioners of the free and open-source spirit and the main force of the Nukkit ecosystem, we feel it necessary to take over the task of Nukkit core development, continuing the chapter of core development by Chinese developers that was left behind by EaseCation.

## Advantages of PNX:
